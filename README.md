# CPUSchedulerSim
This project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator designed to model and analyze different process scheduling strategies such as FIFO, SJF, SRT, and Round Robin (RR). It provides a configurable environment where processes are defined with their arrival time, CPU burst time, and priority, and then executed according to the selected scheduling policy.
